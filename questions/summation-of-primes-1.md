You will be given a range `L` and `R` (both inclusive). Find the summation of all prime numbers in this range.

**Input Format**

 - First line contains a single integer `Q`
 - Next `Q` lines contain two integers `L` and `R` respectively.

**Constraints**

 - `Q` <= `100`
 - `1` <= `L`, `R` <= `1000000`
 - `L < R`

**Output Format**

A single integer denotes the sum of prime numbers on every line.

**Sample Input**
```
2
1 9
4 13
```

**Sample Output**
```
17
36
```

**Explanation**

```
2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17
5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 36
```
