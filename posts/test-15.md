Disk reads are 4x (for SSD) to 80x (for magnetic disk) [slower](https://gist.github.com/hellerbarde/2843375) as compared to main memory (RAM) reads and hence it becomes extremely important for a database to utilize main memory as much as it can, and be super-performant while keeping its latencies to a bare minimum. Engines cannot simply replace disks with RAM because of volatility and cost, hence it needs to strike a balance between the two - maximize main-memory utilization and minimize the disk access.
The database engine virtually splits the data files into pages. A page is a unit which represents how much data the engine transfers at any one time between the disk (the data files) and the main memory. It is usually a few kilobytes 4KB, 8KB, 16KB, 32KB, etc. and is configurable via engine parameters. Because of its bulky size, a page can hold one or multiple rows of a table depending on how much data is in each row i.e. the length of the row.
# Locality of reference
Database systems exhibit a strong and predictable behaviour called [locality of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference) which suggests the access pattern of a page and its neighbours.
